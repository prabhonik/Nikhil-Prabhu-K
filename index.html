                    <p class="hobbyinfo">
                    I love trekking and swimming, I swim in the lakes, rivers and spend my time near water falls. I am not an expert in swimming, but I love being in water and in between forests and hills. Being between nature gives a different feel which I cannot put that in words. I oftenly felt that I have magnetic power within me which attracts me and takes me towards hills, falls and jungles.

                    <p class="hobbyinfo">
                        Briefly explaining about What numismatics is?<br>
                        The study of the physical embodiment of various payment media (i.e. currencies). The study of numismatics as it applies to coins is often in the research of the production and use of the coins to determine their rarity.<br>
                        In simple I collect Coins and Notes of different countries and of different types. I also have many very old coins may be approx 250 years old.

                        Briefly explaining about What Philately is?<br>
                        Philately, the study of postage stamps, stamped envelopes, postmarks, postcards, and other materials relating to postal delivery. The term philately also denotes the collecting of these items.<br>
                        I have stamps of differnet countries which are decades old. Some are centuries old too. Philatelists have this keen excitemnt of knowing about different cultures, traditions, geography, biography, history and art.

                    <p class="hobbyinfo">
                        What I mean by mentioning personal finance is, I am much intrested in finance especially equity market. Its completely not about spending or managing money. I do fundamental analysis of the listed companies. In brief fundemental analysis means the financials, balace sheets, various ratiosb related to financials, the products and its demand in future, their business model and many other things like such.<br> I also do technical analysis. There are differnet technical ways to analyze. I use Candelstick patterns with RSI and MACD. It helps us to find the support and resistance in the price of any stock. Its the ratios, patterns, symetries, cycles which helps in doing analysis and I realized how amazing these things are and How accurate they are.

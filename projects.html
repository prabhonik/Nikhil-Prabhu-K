                    Utilizing my skills, I worked on some mini-projects and major projects. It would be a better statement if I said "working on these projects made me more skilled." Let me share some of the projects we worked on, and what my role was. Let me share abstract, requirements, brief description of project, some screenshots and video demonstration/ link of hosted projects.

                    The main theme behind the project is to pay tribute to Frontline healthcare workers:<br>
                    Early in March 2020, people across the world were running their daily schedules and even planning international trips for the summer. School children were all set to finish their exams and dive into their summer vacation. Unfortunately, on this day last year, everything took a turn for the world’s population.<br>
                    The coronavirus had made its way to countries across the world. With the increasing number of positive cases and deaths, country leaders called for complete lockdowns in their respective nations. March 25th marks the day of the ‘Janata Curfew’ called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi across India.<br>
                    Today, more than 2.75 million have lost the battle against this disease. On the anniversary of the lockdown, we remember some of these fallen heroes, and we pay our respects to all those who’ve fought hard.

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p class="para">
                    The main theme behind the project is to use the basic concepts of computer graphics to draw package mostly from the scratch.<br>
                    Rivers are the backbone of human civilization. They provide us with fresh water, which is helpful for various purposes such as drinking, cleaning, washing, etc. Without rivers, life will come to a halt. Rivers just keep on flowing without any stop. We humans exist because of rivers. Boating is always fun and is one of the most ancient means of transportation. Riding a boat makes you connect with nature and your inner self too.<br>
                    The mini project includes concepts involved in this project polygon drawing and color filling and the translation of the boat from one end to other. We have built a package from scratch and basis of computer graphics by programming in openGL.<br>
                    We will be using Glut to make the project and we will be using CodeBlocks are the Development Environment to develop the project.

                This is a website designed for a training institute that consist of all basic tool elements like Text box, Check box, Radio Buttons, Buttons, Links etc. This also consists Forms, Alerts, Frames, Windows, Widgets and Quiz.<br>
                This helps the institute to train, demonstrate and explain the basic concepts of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP to their students easily. The website visiters can also contact the company to join for Selenium Certification Training through the advertisement in the top of the webpage.<br>
                Special thanks to my project guide from the company Kunal Wani for the continuous guidence and assistance. My heartful gratitude for him to giving me this opportunity to develop a website and giving me the best guidance without which the project wouldn't been a success.

                I had an opportunity to be an intern for Bionic Engineers, Bangalore. I worked there from 19th August 2021 to 27th September 2021. We as a team developed a website for a "Sri Maruthi Pharma". The project had both functional web pages and the backend database.

                My role in the team was to work on the backend. With the good coordination from the team I successfully created a webpage to take data from the contact us page and save it in the database. The data can be viewed by the admin in admin page. Only the company employee can login to view the feedback submitted by the customers or clients of the company. The admin page has some functionalities like sort, search and delete.

            <center><iframe class="projectimg" src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14O0wq4Befn-BKv2DVU8tKGajGa0u-9nW/preview" width="100%" height="600px" allow="autoplay"></iframe></center>

                The main theme behind the project is to use the basic concepts of computer graphics to draw package mostly from the scratch.<br>
                    Rivers are the backbone of human civilization. They provide us with fresh water, which is helpful for various purposes such as drinking, cleaning, washing, etc. Without rivers, life will come to a halt. Rivers just keep on flowing without any stop. We humans exist because of rivers. Boating is always fun and is one of the most ancient means of transportation. Riding a boat makes you connect with nature and your inner self too.<br>
                    The mini project includes concepts involved in this project polygon drawing and color filling and the translation of the boat from one end to other. We have built a package from scratch and basis of computer graphics by programming in openGL.<br>
                    We will be using Glut to make the project and we will be using CodeBlocks are the Development Environment to develop the project.<br>
                    Step 1: Start<br>
                    Step 2: Program begins with main function and displays the welcome in compiler screen and it will provide guidelines regarding various interactions.<br>
                    Step 3: Press any key to enter.<br>
                    Step 4: If ‘b or B’ key is pressed the boat will arrive, If ‘b or B’ key is pressed again boat will depart.<br>
                    Step 6: If ‘d’ key is pressed it will turn on day mode.<br>
                    Step 7: If ‘n’ key is pressed it will turn on night mode.<br>
                    Step 8: Stop<br>
                    I was part of team of two. Me and my team mate together designed and worked on the whole project. This was the first mini project on Computer Graphics.
